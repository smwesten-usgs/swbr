\title{Calculate accumulated potential water loss.}
\usage{
calc_APWL(max_soil_moisture_in, soil_moisture_in)
}
\arguments{
\item{max_soil_moisture_in}{Maximum soil moisture storage with the root zone, in inches.}

\item{soil_moisture_in}{Soil moisture, in inches.}
}
\value{
Accumulated potential water loss in inches.
}
\description{
This function returns a calculated accumulated potential water loss value given
the current soil moisture and maximum soil moisture for the soil.
}
\details{
The value is generated from a nonlinear equation fit to the data values given in
Thornthwaite and Mather (1957).
